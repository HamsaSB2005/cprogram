# cprogram
 C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It is one of the most widely used programming languages, particularly for system programming and embedded systems.
#include <stdio.h> // Preprocessor directive

int main() { // Entry point of the program

1. Basic Data Types
These are the fundamental data types in C:

int: Used to store integers.

Example: int age = 25;
Variants: short int, long int, unsigned int
float: Used to store single-precision floating-point numbers.

Example: float pi = 3.14;
double: Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers.

Example: double pi = 3.14159265359;
char: Used to store a single character.

Example: char grade = 'A';
